Despite its simplicity google-cms provides interesting features. Since Google Docs is used as a text editor we get:
  * Wysiwyg
  * Images import and resizing
  * Find and replace
  * Equations
  * Infinite undo (revisions)
  * Spell checker (37 languages)
  * Collaborative features: simultaneous edition, chat and comments
  * Highly secure login: SSL, Captcha and password recovery
  * Most navigators supported (included Android and iOS)
  * Trusted product which has already been tried and tested, and keeps being maintained by Google.

The unique function of this CMS consists in synchronizing Google Docs with a web server. Each GDocument corresponds to a web page. Few treatments are preformed during the transition from Google Docs to the web site.
  * A very basic template allows to assemble the page content with an existing design
  * Mail anti-spam protection using javascript ROT13 encryption

Pages are then stored on the web server using the Google Docs' naming hierarchy. For example the page "Notre universit√©" in the folder "Contact" will be stored in "/contact/notre-universite.php", thus providing:
  * Friendly URLs

Files are also synchronized, so the whole web site can be stored on Google Docs and new files can be uploaded via a web browser:
  * Incremental backup of the entire site on the Google cloud
  * File upload with drag'n'drop, progress bar and multiple elements support

The Google Doc's file sharing can be used to share the google-cms.php code between all the powered sites:
  * Auto-update of the CMS
